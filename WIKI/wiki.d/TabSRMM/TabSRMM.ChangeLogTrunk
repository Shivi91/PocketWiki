Task bar tabs should%0a	  now work with classic and non-aero themes in Windows 7 (no thumbnails, though,%0a	  because they require Aero to be active).%0a	  %0a	* renamed misleading option for task bar support as it implied to require an Aero%0a	  theme (which is not the case).%0a	%0a	* another tool bar rendering fix - don't use gradients for the tool bar background%0a	  at all with classic Windows theme, unless both tool bar background colors are %0a	  properly set.%0a%0a	* Aero peek (task bar tabs) now default to enabled.%0a%0aVersion 3.0.0.35 - 2010/05/29%0a%0a	* taskbar thumbnails (Win7): better support for MUC tabs, set active session%0a	  should now work.%0a	  %0a	* autoclose tabs: converted to a more useful autoclose/autohide container %0a	  feature and moved to container options.%0a	  %0a	* fixed a bug where installing a language pack could break hotkeys (translation%0a	  issue)%0a	%0a	* fixed "black tool bar bug" when classic windows theme is active on XP or later.%0a%0aVersion 3.0.0.34 - 2010/05/27%0a%0a	* fixed crash when running on Windows 2000%0a	%0a	* cleaned up the mess in the TSButton class%0a	%0a	* More work on Aero Peek thumbnail previews.

Per tab thumbnails are partially%0a	  implemented, so you get a similar UI as seen in other tabbed applications%0a	  under Windows 7 (IE 8, Opera 10, for example). Still experimental, so it is %0a	  disabled by default (Message Sessions->Advanced tweaks is where you can enable%0a	  it).

Old log files%0a	  are archived when the size exceeds the maximum allowed length for a single%0a	  channel log file.%0a%0a	* updated some dialogs to make more space for translations.%0a%0a	* added UI button for quickly opening the MUC logs base folder.%0a%0a	* implemented right and middle click actions for side bar buttons (close/context%0a	  menu)%0a%0aVersion 3.0.0.29 - 2010/05/11%0a%0a	* fixed a number of drawing problems%0a%0a	* DB tweak to force tool bar always use visual styles%0a%0a	* added 2 new common colors for painting the UI in aero and visual styles%0a	  mode.%0a%0a	* improved exporting and importing of theme files to support UI settings that%0a	  are new in TabSRMM 3.%0a%0aVersion 3.0.0.27 - 2010/05/06%0a%0a	* send menu pulldown button is now always available, even if the%0a	  send button itself is disabled.%0a%0a	* fixed few problems with tool bar configuration dialog.%0a%0a	* send later UI improved%0a%0a	* skin selection dialog improved (added button for quickly closing%0a	  all open message windows when loading or unloading a skin).%0a%0aVersion 3.0.0.26 - 2010/04/30%0a%0a	* fixed the painting of close buttons on tabs when using a skin (they%0a	  were incorrectly using visual styles instead of the button skin)%0a%0a	* new skin item for the switch bar background%0a%0a	* send later out of hidden state (see: http://wiki.miranda.or.at/SendLater)%0a%0aVersion 3.0.0.25 - 2010/04/23%0a%0a	* bug fixes%0a	* added two new switch bar layouts (more complex, allow showing avatars%0a	  on the switch bar buttons).%0a	* fix for a crash when AVS plugin is not available.%0a%0aVersion 3.0.0.22 - 2010/04/01%0a%0a	* Alpha snapshot released to my googlecode site.%0a	* many bug fixes and small improvements, new skin selection dialog%0a	* still INCOMPLETE and not all features are fully working.%0a%0aVersion 3.0.0.8  - 3.0.0.21%0a%0a	* again, many, many changes and new things.
