text=(:title Database tweaks for TabSRMM 3:)%0a%3c|[[TabSRMM.#reference#endreference|Page Index]]|>%0a= Database tweaks (aka hidden settings) =%0a[[#teaser]]%0aThis article lists all known database values that can be modified by the user in order to tweak some features. Unless otherwise noted, the values are dynamically read whenever needed so it generally is not required to restart Miranda after applying a change. They should be seen in the same way as Windows registry tweaks - use them with care.%0a%0aMost of these values do not exist for a fresh TabSRMM installation, so it is normal when you cannot find them with dbeditor+. The default values for these settings are hardcoded in the plugin and you can override them by creating the corresponding database values.%0a%0aSome of these tweaks are experimental and should be used with care. They may trigger unknown bugs and most of these settings are not tested on a wide range of possible configurations.%0a[[#teaserend]]%0a%0a(:include Template/Formatting#hint#endhint Text="The module name for all TabSRMM database tweaks is **Tab_SRMsg**.\\To change database values, you need the [[Plugins/DBEditor|+]]\\All setting names are **case sensitive!**":)\\%0a%0a=== taskBarIconAlpha ===%0a%0a%25red%25BYTE%25%25 value indicating transparency of avatars on the task bar. A value of 255 will make task bar avatars to be fully opaque, lower values can be used to make them more transparent in order to improve the visibility of the overlaid status icon. Task bar avatar will be updated to reflect the change at the next creation which usually happens when a message window is opened or the avatar changes while a window is open.%0a%0a=== inputFontFix ===%0a%0a%25red%25BYTE%25%25 value. If you set this to 0, TabSRMM will no longer strip font attributes from the message input area font setting, so you can have bold/italic/underline fonts for the writing area. Be aware that this '''might''' confuse the formatting parser and using a bold font by default could lead to a situation where you will always send bold text to IRC channels. A restart (or at least changing a setting which will trigger a reload of all font settings) is required.%0a%0a=== quoteLineLength ===%0a%0a%25red%25DWORD%25%25 value that specifies the enforced line length for the "quote message" function. Default are 64 characters. When using the quote feature, TabSRMM will reformat the quoted text to this line length and add standard email quoting characters (>) at the beginning of each line.%0a%0a=== forceThemedToolbar ===%0a%0a%25red%25BYTE%25%25 value. Render the toolbar using Visual Styles, regardless of other settings. Essentially, this will disable the colored gradients on the message window toolbar and paint a standard visual styles toolbar background instead. This setting is applied immediately at the next redraw, no restart or other action is required.%0a%0a=== disableVScroll ===%0a%0a%25red%25BYTE%25%25 value. If this value is present and not equal to zero, the vertical scroll bars on the message window text fields will be disabled. Scrolling should still be possible by using the mouse wheel or keyboard shortcuts.%0a%0a(:include Template/Formatting#note#endnote Text="'''This is experimental and unsupported and can cause problems with certain versions of the RichEdit control'''. Also, loading a skin will override it, because skins have their own setting for scroll bar visibility. The setting works with '''the default message log only'''.

When this is set to 1, TabSRMM will try to paint the borders around IEView. To make this work properly, %25class=option%25Message Sessions->IEview->General[tab]->Hide window border%25%25 must be '''CHECKED''', otherwise you may see a double border around the IEView message log.%0a%0a(:include Template/Formatting#note#endnote Text="This is totally unsupported and may cause serious troubles with certain combinations of Internet Explorer, TabSRMM, Windows, IEView and so on. Do not report bugs with that setting enabled, they will be marked invalid without further notice.":)%0a%0a->**If you experience strange behavior with IEView, like flickering, drawing errors or even crashes when opening a message window, you should immediately disable this option (delete the database value, restart Miranda).**%0a%0a=== forceTaskBarStatusOverlays ===%0a%0aWhen running on Windows 7 and using the large task bar (aka "superbar"), TabSRMM will use overlay icons on the task bar buttons when appropriate. For example, things like typing- or message notifications are using overlay icons to indicate certain activity. %0a%0aBy setting this %25red%25BYTE%25%25 value to 1, overlays icons are always enforced.

The setting is global for all containers.%0a%0aThis setting has no effect when not running on Windows 7 or when not using the large task bar.
